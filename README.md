## While Loops

1. **_What are while loops?_**<br>
   _ans. While loops let the computer execute a set of instructions while a condition is true._

2. **_Fill in the blanks to make the print_prime_factors function print all the prime factors of a number. A prime factor is a number that is prime and divides another without a remainder._**

```Python
def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = ___
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == ___:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      ___
  return "Done"

print_prime_factors(100)
# Should print 2,2,5,5
# DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
```

_ans._

```Python
def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = 2
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == 0:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      factor += 1
  return "Done"

print_prime_factors(100)
# Should print 2,2,5,5
# DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
```

3. **_The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers. Note: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input, and see what you get!_**

```Python
def is_power_of_two(n):
  # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
  while n % 2 == 0:
    n = n / 2
  # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
  if n == 1:
    return True
  return False


print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
```

_ans._

```Python
def is_power_of_two(n):
  # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
  while n % 2 == 0 and n != 0:
    n = n / 2
  # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
  if n == 1:
    return True
  return False


print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
```

4. **_Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder._**

```Python
def sum_divisors(n):
  sum = 0
  # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
  return sum

print(sum_divisors(0))
# 0
print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
# 1
print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
# 55
print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
# 114
```

_ans._

```Python
def sum_divisors(n):
  x = 1
  sum = 0
  # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
  while x < n:
    if n % x == 0:
      sum += x
      x += 1
    else:
        x += 1
  return sum

print(sum_divisors(0))
# 0
print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
# 1
print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
# 55
print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
# 114
```

5. **_The multiplication_table function prints the results of a number passed to it multiplied by 1 through 5. An additional requirement is that the result is not to exceed 25, which is done with the break statement. Fill in the blanks to complete the function to satisfy these conditions._**

```Python
def multiplication_table(number):
	# Initialize the starting point of the multiplication table
	multiplier = 1
	# Only want to loop through 5
	while multiplier <= 5:
		result = ___
		# What is the additional condition to exit out of the loop?
		if ___ :
			break
		print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
		# Increment the variable for the loop
		___ += 1

multiplication_table(3)
# Should print: 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 3x4=12 3x5=15

multiplication_table(5)
# Should print: 5x1=5 5x2=10 5x3=15 5x4=20 5x5=25

multiplication_table(8)
# Should print: 8x1=8 8x2=16 8x3=24
```

_ans._

```Python
def multiplication_table(number):
	# Initialize the starting point of the multiplication table
	multiplier = 1
	# Only want to loop through 5
	while multiplier <= 5:
		result = number * multiplier
		# What is the additional condition to exit out of the loop?
		if result > 25 :
			break
		print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
		# Increment the variable for the loop
		multiplier += 1

multiplication_table(3)
# Should print: 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 3x4=12 3x5=15

multiplication_table(5)
# Should print: 5x1=5 5x2=10 5x3=15 5x4=20 5x5=25

multiplication_table(8)
# Should print: 8x1=8 8x2=16 8x3=24
```

## For Loops

1. ***How are while loops and for loops different in Python?***<br>
*ans. While loops iterate while a condition is true, for loops iterate through a sequence of elements.*

2. ___Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 *5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.___
```Python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,___):
        result = ___ * ___
    return ___

for n in range(___,___):
    print(n, factorial(n+___))
```
*ans.*
```Python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1, n):
        result *= x
    return result
for n in range(1, 10):
    print(n, factorial(n+1))
```

3. ___Write a script that prints the first 10 cube numbers (X ** 3), starting with x=1 and ending with x=10.___
```Python
for x in range(1,11):
  print(x**3)
```

4. ***Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.***
```Python
for m in range(101):
    if m % 7 == 0:
        print(m)
```

5. ***The retry function tries to execute an operation that might fail, it retries the operation for a number of attempts.  Currently the code will keep executing the function even if it succeeds. Fill in the blank so the code stops trying after the operation succeeded.***
```Python
def retry(operation, attempts):
  for n in range(attempts):
    if operation():
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " succeeded")
    ___
    else:
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " failed")

retry(create_user, 3)
retry(stop_service, 5)
```
*ans.*
```Python
def retry(operation, attempts):
  for n in range(attempts):
    if operation():
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " succeeded")
      break
    else:
      print("Attempt " + str(n) + " failed")

retry(create_user, 3)
retry(stop_service, 5)
```
